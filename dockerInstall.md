# Docker setup
This is a guide Franklin gave me. It really helped getting me going.

## Notes
- In the future, I would look at Docker documentation for installing the GPG key and Repo.
- Docker Engine and Docker Compose are installed first. Then Portainer. The containers.
- The Docker Compose file has portainter and pihole in one file. This is a stack in portainer.
- Everything is really done in the /opt directory.
- Targets a RPi. If not using the pi user, be sure to give privileges to the user.

## Steps
1. Set static IP: `vi ~/etc/dhcpcd.conf`

2. Reboot: `sudo reboot`

3. Update: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

4. Install vim: `sudo apt install vim`

5. Install Docker Engine [See Docker Ubuntu official steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods)
- Set up the repository. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
 - `sudo apt-get install ca-ce`
- Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key
``` 
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/raspbian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

- Use the following command to set up the repository (**Tagets Raspbian**)
```
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/raspbian \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

- Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose: `sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin`
- Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image: `sudo docker run hello-world`
- This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.
 
6. Set the current user (in my case "franklin") in the group "docker"
`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

7. Logout to update privileges 
`logout`

8. Verify current user is in the groups. you should see "docker" in the list
`groups`

9. Go to the /opt/ directory
`cd ~/opt/`

10. Make sure current user has privileges to create a "docker-compose.yaml" file. Currently, mine was set where only "root" had permissions.
```
sudo chown franklin:franklin .
sudo chown franklin:root containerd/
```

11. Make directories for the containers you want to run
```
mkdir portainer
```

12. Create your docker compose file: `vi docker-compose.yaml`

13. Paste this in the file
```services:
  portainer:
   container_name: portainer
   image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
   ports:
     - 9000:9000 # Web Interface
   volumes:
     - /opt/portainer:/data
     - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
   restart: unless-stopped
```

14. Make sure docker service will start if the RPi is every rebooted
`sudo systemctl enable docker`

15. Reboot
`sudo reboot`

16. Run Docker.
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
